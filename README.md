# Impedimetric_analysis
Python scripts to analyze impedimetric measurements <br>

The script "impedimetric_analysis.py" is a GUI (graphical user interface) made in tkinter for selecting an impedimetric analysis technique. User is capable of changing some default settings. When ready, the user clicks "Run!" and the user can now select the files to be analyzed together with the folder for where the output figures shall be saved.

The script "impedimetric_functions.py" contains the different impedimetric analysis techniques that will be used in "impedimetric_analysis.py"
CV_analysis.py: analyze Cyclic voltammetry measurements <br>
EIS_ECS_analysis.py: automatically finds diameter of EIS measurements <br>
convert_EIS_to_ECS: converts impedance values into capacitance
