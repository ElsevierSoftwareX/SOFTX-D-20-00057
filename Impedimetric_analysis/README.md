User is capable of changing some default settings. When ready, the user clicks "Run!" and the user can now select the files to be analyzed together with the folder for where the output figures shall be saved. For more details, see "Tutorial_on_how_to_run_impedimetric_analysis.pdf".<br>

IMPORTANT: all python scripts must be in SAME folder in order to work properly.
